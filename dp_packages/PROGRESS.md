# Project Evaluation Progress

This document outlines the progress made during the critical evaluation of the DPug project, including identified inconsistencies, completed refactoring steps, and remaining tasks.

## Current Status

The primary goal of this evaluation is to identify and resolve inconsistencies, duplication, and errors across the `dpug_code_builder`, `dpug_core`, and `dpug_server` packages.

### Dependency Resolution

- **SDK Version Unification:** The `environment: sdk` constraint in all `pubspec.yaml` files (`dpug_code_builder`, `dpug_core`, `dpug_server`) was updated to `^3.8.3`.
- **`pubspec.lock` Updates:** `dart pub get` was run successfully in `dpug_code_builder`, `dpug_core`, and `dpug_server` to update their respective `pubspec.lock` files.
  - _Note:_ During this process, it was discovered that the local Dart SDK version was `3.8.1`, which caused initial failures. The user confirmed they had adjusted their `pubspec.yaml` files to `3.8.1` to unblock the process. This means the current `pubspec.yaml` files are set to `3.8.1` and not `3.8.3` as initially intended. This should be revisited if the user updates their Dart SDK.

### Code Refactoring: `dpug_code_builder` and `dpug_core` Overlap

**Identified Inconsistency:**
The `dpug_core/lib/compiler/dart_code_builder.dart` file was found to be generating Dart code using `code_builder`, which is a responsibility that should ideally belong to the `dpug_code_builder` package, as per the project's stated architecture. This led to duplication and architectural inconsistency.

**Completed Refactoring Steps:**

1.  **File Relocation and Renaming:**
    - `dpug_core/lib/compiler/dart_code_builder.dart` was moved to `dpug_code_builder/lib/src/builders/dart_widget_code_generator.dart`.
2.  **Import Path Updates:**
    - Imports in `dpug_core/lib/compiler/ast_to_dart.dart` and `dpug_core/test/dart_code_builder_test.dart` were updated to reflect the new location of `dart_widget_code_generator.dart`.
3.  **`StateField` Class Removal:**
    - The `StateField` class definition was successfully removed from `dpug_code_builder/lib/src/builders/dart_widget_code_generator.dart`.

**Generator status for `dpug_code_builder/lib/src/builders/dart_widget_code_generator.dart`:**

- Imports and `_dpugEmitter` are present.
- Method is named `generateStatefulWidget`.
- Helper signatures use `List<DpugStateFieldSpec>`.

Note: `generateStatefulWidget` expects the `build` method body to already be a Dart `Code` snippet. Passing a widget-spec body directly will generate invalid Dart. Either pass a `DpugCodeSpec` that returns a widget, or adapt the generator to convert widget specs to Dart before wrapping.

## Next Steps

Once the manual changes to `dpug_code_builder/lib/src/builders/dart_widget_code_generator.dart` are confirmed, the evaluation will continue with:

- Verifying the `dpug_core` package's `DpugConverter` and its interaction with the refactored `dpug_code_builder`.
- Evaluating the `dpug_server` implementation against its documented API.
- Identifying any further inconsistencies, duplications, or errors across the entire project.

## Current Issues and Actions

1. `AstToDart` uses a non-existent factory for the build method body.

- Current: `DpugExpressionSpec.code('return ...')`.
- Action: replace with `DpugCodeSpec('return ...')`.

2. `build.yaml` builder import path mismatch.

- Current: `package:dpug/compiler/builder.dart`.
- Action: change to `package:dpug_core/compiler/builder.dart`.

3. Server error content type and docs alignment.

- Current: YAML-shaped text is returned with `text/plain`.
- Action: either change server to `application/yaml` or keep as-is and document (GEMINI.md updated).
