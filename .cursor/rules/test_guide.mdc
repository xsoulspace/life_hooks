# Test Guidelines

This guide outlines concise rules for writing and modifying tests in this project.

## 1. Data-Driven Structure

- Use maps (e.g., `Map<String, ({...})>`) to define test cases.
- Iterate over cases with `forEach` to minimize boilerplate.

## 2. Test Organization

- Group related tests using `group()` and individual cases using `test()`.
- Name tests and groups descriptively (e.g., "parses various currency formats", "formats EUR in different locales").

## 3. Input & Expected Outputs

- Define inputs and expected outputs clearly in your maps.
- Separate cases for different locales or edge conditions.

## 4. Assertions

- Use `expect()` with a clear `reason` to explain failures.
- Assert each property (price, symbols, code) individually.

## 5. General Best Practices

- Keep tests self-contained and independent.
- Write concise, readable tests that are easy to update.
- Use data-driven approaches to facilitate modifications and extensions.
