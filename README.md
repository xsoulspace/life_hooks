# XSoulspace helper packages

This repository contains some packages that I use for my personal, commercial projects and also for learning purposes for Dart and Flutter.

# Overview

## Production and maintable:

All libraries except hooks (xsoulspace_lints, xsoulspace_foundation, xsoulspace_lints) now migrated to [https://github.com/xsoulspace/dart_flutter_packages](dart_flutter_packages)

- **[life_hooks](https://pub.dev/packages/life_hooks)**: Useful hooks for managing state and lifecycle in Flutter applications.

## Outdated and maybe will be deprecated:

- [supabase_hooks](https://pub.dev/packages/supabase_hooks) for supabase state management.
